# Chat-App
Chat application in javascript. 
(One of my first uses of js)

Utilisation:

1. First of all, change "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS" in index.html by obviusly your ip address. 

2. Then run server.js (node server.js)

3. Finally connect you to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000 on the device of your choice. You should be able to chat beetween your device. Make sure you use the same network !
